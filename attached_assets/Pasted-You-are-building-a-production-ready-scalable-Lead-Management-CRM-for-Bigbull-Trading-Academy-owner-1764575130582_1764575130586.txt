3) API Design

Implement clean, REST-style routes:

POST /api/auth/login → returns { token }

GET /api/leads?status=&source=&funnelDay=&q= → list leads

POST /api/leads → create lead

GET /api/leads/:id → fetch lead details

PUT /api/leads/:id → update lead

POST /api/leads/import → import CSV

GET /api/leads/export → export CSV

POST /api/leads/:id/actions → add note / schedule follow-up

GET /api/templates → fetch follow-up templates

POST /api/send-template → simulate sending a template

4) UX / UI Requirements
